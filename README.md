# SSO Stub

This repo contains a simple stub Single Sign-on server for local application development. The aim is to make working with
ITS web applications (e.g. [Tabula](https://github.com/UniversityofWarwick/tabula)) painless.

## Getting started

This application ships with Docker support. To build, tag and run a local container image, perform the following steps:

```
 $ ./sbt docker:stage
 $ ./sbt docker:publishLocal
 $ docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8090:8080 sso-stub
```

In this example the app will be available on the host on port 8090 over HTTP. You can also forward port 8443 if you want HTTPS.

To start the development server locally (without using Docker) on ports 8090 and 8443 (HTTP and self-signed auto TLS respectively) you can instead execute the `run.sh` script:

```
$ ./run.sh
```
